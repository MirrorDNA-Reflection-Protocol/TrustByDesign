## No-Autonomy Disclaimer

**HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP REQUIREMENT:**
Systems implementing TrustByDesign protocols are designed with the assumption of **continuous human oversight and judgment**.

**THESE SYSTEMS MUST NOT:**
- Operate autonomously in safety-critical contexts without human review
- Make binding decisions without human authorization
- Execute irreversible actions without human confirmation
- Override human judgment or control mechanisms

**Level 3 (Autonomous) compliance** in this framework refers to systems that are *capable* of self-directed action, but still require governance oversight, transparency, and human-reviewable audit trails.

Deployers are responsible for ensuring appropriate human oversight for their specific use case.
